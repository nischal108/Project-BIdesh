As a tech enthusiast, I've always had a dream of creating something on my own while also learning new skills. Upon completing high school, I decided to pursue web development, despite having no prior experience in the field. However, I soon realized that my learning style was different from traditional methods, and I struggled with understanding concepts when taught through books or lectures.To overcome this challenge, I decided to take a hands-on approach and learn by creating a project. I came up with the idea of building a website from scratch, even though I had no idea where to start. I planned to seek guidance from various sources and use their insights to guide me through the process of website creation. I understand that creating a website from scratch can be a challenging task, but I believe that this approach will enable me to gain practical skills and knowledge that traditional learning methods cannot provide. I am excited to embark on this journey of self-discovery and hope to make something unique that I can be proud of.

As a technology enthusiast with a strong desire for entrepreneurship, I have always aspired to be self-reliant and achieve my goals on my own. When I completed high school, I noticed that many of my peers were looking to study abroad, but I decided to stay in Nepal and continue my education here. During this time, I saw a friend who was struggling to get basic information and support while applying to study in Australia. This experience made me realize that there is a significant gap in the Nepali market for a reliable platform that provides comprehensive and accurate information for students who wish to study abroad. Motivated by my entrepreneurial spirit and passion for technology, I decided to start working on Bidesh, a website that aims to serve as a one-stop-shop for students seeking information on studying abroad. I understand that this venture is not a quick solution to achieving my long-term goals, but it is a step towards my larger aspirations. My goal with Bidesh is to provide students with all the essential information they need, including requirements, application procedures, and visa guidelines. I believe that by filling this gap in the Nepali market, I can make a meaningful impact on the lives of aspiring students and help them achieve their dreams.

I am often called an overthinker or someone who sets his sights too high. But let me assure you, I am that same person. While my knowledge may be limited to simple web development, it does not deter me from dreaming big for Bidesh. I have a grand vision for the platform that goes beyond being just an information provider. In the future, I plan to expand Bidesh to offer paid courses for exams like IELTS and SAT, as well as other courses that are required for studying abroad. I also envision a section on the website where students can connect with professionals in their respective fields through one-on-one video calls for mentoring. My ultimate goal is to transform Bidesh into a company that assists students from the very beginning of their study abroad journey to the moment they arrive in their destination country. I am confident that with hard work and dedication, Bidesh can be a game-changer in the Nepali market, offering students unparalleled support and resources to achieve their dreams
